# learning_php
These are all scripts I have been working on to hone my PHP skills. I am using Xampp as my local server solution stack.
I am using linux, Ubuntu 16.0.6 64 bit so all of these files can be found in the directory "/opt/lampp/htdocs".
To run these files I open my web browser (mozilla firefox) and navigate to "http://localhost/(file_name)".
